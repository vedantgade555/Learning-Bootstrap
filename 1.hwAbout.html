                        <h1>Ganesh Festival</h1>
                        Ganesh Festival, also known as Ganesh Chaturthi, is a popular Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Lord Ganesha, the god of wisdom, prosperity, and remover of obstacles. The festival has been celebrated in India since ancient times, originally as a private household ritual. In 1893, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak transformed it into a public festival in Maharashtra to unite people during British rule and promote social and cultural activities. During the festival, clay idols of Lord Ganesha are installed in homes and public pandals, where devotees offer flowers, fruits, sweets (especially modak), and prayers. Cultural programs, music, dance, and social service activities are also organized. The festival usually lasts from 1.5 to 10 days, depending on tradition, and concludes with Visarjan, where the idols are immersed in water amid chants of “Ganpati Bappa Morya”. Ganesh Chaturthi not only promotes devotion but also fosters community bonding, cultural expression, and eco-conscious practices, making it one of the most loved and widely celebrated festivals in India.

                                    Ancient Roots

                                    References of Lord Ganesha appear in
                                    Rigveda, Puranas, and early Hindu
                                    scriptures.

                                    Ganesh Chaturthi has been celebrated in
                                    India since the 4th–5th century (Gupta
                                    period).

                                    Traditionally, it was a private household
                                    puja.

                                    2. Revival in 19th Century

                                    In 1893, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak made
                                    Ganesh Utsav a public festival in
                                    Maharashtra.

                                    Reason: The British government banned
                                    political gatherings; Tilak used Ganesha as
                                    a symbol of national unity and resistance.

                                    Ganesh mandals became centers of freedom
                                    movement, debates, and cultural exchange.

                                    3. Modern Celebrations

                                    Today, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated:

                                    At homes – small clay idols, family prayers,
                                    and immersion in local water bodies.

                                    In public pandals – large idols, cultural
                                    programs, community feasts, charity events.

                                    Popular in Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka,
                                    Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu,
                                    and also celebrated abroad (USA, UK,
                                    Mauritius, UAE).

                                    4. Eco-friendly Movement

                                    Since early 2000s, environmental concerns
                                    have led to:

                                    Use of natural clay idols instead of Plaster
                                    of Paris.

                                    Ban on harmful chemical paints.

                                    Artificial water tanks for immersion.

                                    Festival”.
